Welcome to the bytemine manager
===============================

The bytemine manager is a graphical Desktop-Application
to manage OpenVPN Servers as well as users and certificates
involved in the process.

The bytemine manager requires a Java 1.6 or 1.7 (or to use Sun
versioning, 6 or 7) runtime environment.

- New bytemine manager repository
  We had to start the bytemine manager repository from scratch. Sorry for the 
  inconvenience.

- Building packages
  - General requirements:
    - JDK, at least version 6
    - ant
    - ant-optional package

  - Windows:
    In order to build the windows package simply call `ant` from your checkout directory. The archive will be created at `./dist/bytemine` and contains a `start-manager.jar` to run the software.

  - Debian:
    In order to build .deb packages on your machine at least the packages `build-essential` and `dpkg-dev` have to be installed, as the script uses `dpkg-buildpackage`.
    If these packages are installed simply run `sh build-deb.sh` to create a .deb file inside the top directory of the current checkout directory.

  - Specials:
    - Windows Executable:
      To build a Windows executable file you have to install launch4j (http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) on your building platform. You may need to adjust the path 
      to your launch4j installation in build.xml by changing the value of property `launch4j.dir`.
      The executable file will be contained inside the created archive.

    - Manuals:
      To create the manuals during build process a TeX system has to be installed on your building platform.
